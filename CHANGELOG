## Unreleased

* [BREAKING FEATURE] Add mysql_default_timezone resource and provision by
  default to Europe/London - customise with the node.mysql.default-time-zone
  attribute. Throws a LegacyAttributeDefinitionError if there's a default-time-zone
  attribute in the custom_config definition.
* [FEATURE] Add user_mysql_config resource and provision a default .my.cnf for
  root at /root/.my.cnf when installing a mysql server
* Updated to the 6.0 series apt cookbook
* [BUGFIX] Add a workaround to fix the default mysql logrotate config that no
  longer works per chef-cookbooks/mysql#294 due to the multi-instance setup.
  Solution inspired by https://github.com/flatrocks/cookbook-mysql_logrotate.
* Updated to the 6.x series database cookbook

## 0.2.0 (2016-09-09)

* [BREAKING] Updated to new mysql and database cookbooks - this will break lots
  of things. Ensure you deploy this to a clean instance, not over the top of
  provisioning delivered by a previous version of the cookbook.
* [BREAKING] Now throws exceptions if using insecure default passwords outside
  a :localdev or :buildslave environment.
* [BREAKING] No longer listens on 0.0.0.0 on development boxes by default, use
  ssh forwarding.
* [BREAKING] No longer supports the out-of-box debian-sys-maint or replication
  users - provision them separately if required.
* [FEATURE] Provides a `node.mysql_root_connection()` method that returns a hash
  with everything you need to connect as root. Note that the keys are symbols,
  not strings.

## 0.1.0 (2016-09-06)

* First tagged release
