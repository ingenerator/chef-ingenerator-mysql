## Unreleased

* Updated to the 6.x series database cookbook

## 0.2.0 (2016-09-09)

* [BREAKING] Updated to new mysql and database cookbooks - this will break lots
  of things. Ensure you deploy this to a clean instance, not over the top of
  provisioning delivered by a previous version of the cookbook.
* [BREAKING] Now throws exceptions if using insecure default passwords outside
  a :localdev or :buildslave environment.
* [BREAKING] No longer listens on 0.0.0.0 on development boxes by default, use
  ssh forwarding.
* [BREAKING] No longer supports the out-of-box debian-sys-maint or replication
  users - provision them separately if required.
* [FEATURE] Provides a `node.mysql_root_connection()` method that returns a hash
  with everything you need to connect as root. Note that the keys are symbols,
  not strings.

## 0.1.0 (2016-09-06)

* First tagged release
