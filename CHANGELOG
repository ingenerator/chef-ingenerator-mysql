# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/). Note that
0.x versions may be breaking, per the semver standard.

## Unreleased

## 0.4.1 (2017-08-10)

* Fix exclusion of build-time files from vendored cookbook

## 0.4.0 (2017-08-09)

* Exclude build-time code from generated cookbook (in the hope this may improve
  build time)
* Fix namespace collision deprecation warnings in Chef 12
* [POTENTIALLY BREAKING] Require v2 of mysql2_chef_gem for Chef 13 compatibility
  - this may cause issues with downstream dependencies.
* Update build dependencies and build against Chef 12 and Chef 13

## 0.3.0 (2017-02-23)

* Remove explicit install of libmysqlclient-dev - this was a workaround for
  https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/mysql/issues/457 which is now fixed. Bump
  minimum mysql cookbook version to 8.2.0 to ensure that fix is present.
* [BREAKING FEATURE] Move app_db_server logic into an application_database
  resource to allow simpler reuse on projects with multiple schemas on a single
  instance. Also added the ability to seed a new database - eg when moving to
  a new instance - by dropping a sql file in /tmp/database-seeds.
* [FEATURE] Add mysql_local_admin to provision database access (user and client
  config) for system users that should have access to the db.
* [BREAKING FEATURE] Add mysql_default_timezone resource and provision by
  default to Europe/London - customise with the node.mysql.default-time-zone
  attribute. Throws a LegacyAttributeDefinitionError if there's a default-time-zone
  attribute in the custom_config definition.
* [FEATURE] Add user_mysql_config resource and provision a default .my.cnf for
  root at /root/.my.cnf when installing a mysql server
* Updated to the 6.0 series apt cookbook
* [BUGFIX] Add a workaround to fix the default mysql logrotate config that no
  longer works per chef-cookbooks/mysql#294 due to the multi-instance setup.
  Solution inspired by https://github.com/flatrocks/cookbook-mysql_logrotate.
* Updated to the 6.x series database cookbook

## 0.2.0 (2016-09-09)

* [BREAKING] Updated to new mysql and database cookbooks - this will break lots
  of things. Ensure you deploy this to a clean instance, not over the top of
  provisioning delivered by a previous version of the cookbook.
* [BREAKING] Now throws exceptions if using insecure default passwords outside
  a :localdev or :buildslave environment.
* [BREAKING] No longer listens on 0.0.0.0 on development boxes by default, use
  ssh forwarding.
* [BREAKING] No longer supports the out-of-box debian-sys-maint or replication
  users - provision them separately if required.
* [FEATURE] Provides a `node.mysql_root_connection()` method that returns a hash
  with everything you need to connect as root. Note that the keys are symbols,
  not strings.

## 0.1.0 (2016-09-06)

* First tagged release
