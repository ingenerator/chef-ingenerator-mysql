## Unreleased

* [BUG] compile mysql2 gem against mysqlclient 5.7.27 to resolve segfault when running alongside 5.7.28 or greater.
  There is an incompatibility between some system libraries - potentially openssl - and the ones shipped with chef. When
  the mysql2 gem is installed, by default it compiles the native extension and links it to system libraries for
  mysqlclient-dev but to chef's internal libraries for SSL and other packages. This then causes a segfault at runtime
  because the libs are not compatible. As a workaround, we ship the 5.7.27 version of libmysqlclient and ...-dev from
  the related ubuntu packages. We then provision these into /opt/chef/embedded and then (re)compile the mysql2 gem
  to link against these. This fixes the segfault while leaving the rest of the system happily on 5.7.28 (or later
  updates).

## 0.5.1 (2019-02-25)

* [BUG] mysql config files need to be world-readable. If not then mysql will silently IGNORE them and you will spend
  ages trying to work out why the config settings aren't being applied. Worse, the pre-start command on ubuntu runs
  as root so it can read them and will fail with an error if they have invalid values, but then the actual start command
  runs as mysql so won't see them. FFS.

## 0.5.0 (2019-02-17)

* [BREAKING] Ensure chef isn't trying to move the mysql data directory - leave it configured as /var/lib/mysql and
  bind-mount it if you need it somewhere else. This is *much* easier than mucking about with config, apparmor, etc.
  Note you need the mount point provisioned before you install the mysql package.
* [BREAKING] Drop dependency on mysql cookbook, just install from packages with ubuntu default directories etc -
  service will be `mysql` as standard not the half-broken `mysql-default` the old cookbook tries to provision:
  * REMOVES all concept of root having a password at all - uses local socket auth
  * REMOVES the /root/.my.cnf with password - uses local socket authentication for the root user per mysql/ubuntu
    default
  * COMBINES all custom config into a single my.cnf to ensure it overrides the mysql stuff
  * DROPS various internal resources and recipes
  * LOSES a bunch of spec coverage because this cookbook only has to live another couple of months
  * CHANGES the paths that are managed by the mysql logrotate we provision
* [BREAKING] Drop dependency on mysql2_chef_gem cookbook, just install the gem manually in our server recipe
* [BREAKING] Now triggers our php cookbook to install php7.2-mysql package rather than php5-mysql
* [BREAKING] Now expects to be on Ubuntu 18.04
* [BREAKING] Drop chef12 support

## 0.4.1 (2017-08-10)

* Fix exclusion of build-time files from vendored cookbook

## 0.4.0 (2017-08-09)

* Exclude build-time code from generated cookbook (in the hope this may improve
  build time)
* Fix namespace collision deprecation warnings in Chef 12
* [POTENTIALLY BREAKING] Require v2 of mysql2_chef_gem for Chef 13 compatibility
  - this may cause issues with downstream dependencies.
* Update build dependencies and build against Chef 12 and Chef 13

## 0.3.0 (2017-02-23)

* Remove explicit install of libmysqlclient-dev - this was a workaround for
  https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/mysql/issues/457 which is now fixed. Bump
  minimum mysql cookbook version to 8.2.0 to ensure that fix is present.
* [BREAKING FEATURE] Move app_db_server logic into an application_database
  resource to allow simpler reuse on projects with multiple schemas on a single
  instance. Also added the ability to seed a new database - eg when moving to
  a new instance - by dropping a sql file in /tmp/database-seeds.
* [FEATURE] Add mysql_local_admin to provision database access (user and client
  config) for system users that should have access to the db.
* [BREAKING FEATURE] Add mysql_default_timezone resource and provision by
  default to Europe/London - customise with the node.mysql.default-time-zone
  attribute. Throws a LegacyAttributeDefinitionError if there's a default-time-zone
  attribute in the custom_config definition.
* [FEATURE] Add user_mysql_config resource and provision a default .my.cnf for
  root at /root/.my.cnf when installing a mysql server
* Updated to the 6.0 series apt cookbook
* [BUGFIX] Add a workaround to fix the default mysql logrotate config that no
  longer works per chef-cookbooks/mysql#294 due to the multi-instance setup.
  Solution inspired by https://github.com/flatrocks/cookbook-mysql_logrotate.
* Updated to the 6.x series database cookbook

## 0.2.0 (2016-09-09)

* [BREAKING] Updated to new mysql and database cookbooks - this will break lots
  of things. Ensure you deploy this to a clean instance, not over the top of
  provisioning delivered by a previous version of the cookbook.
* [BREAKING] Now throws exceptions if using insecure default passwords outside
  a :localdev or :buildslave environment.
* [BREAKING] No longer listens on 0.0.0.0 on development boxes by default, use
  ssh forwarding.
* [BREAKING] No longer supports the out-of-box debian-sys-maint or replication
  users - provision them separately if required.
* [FEATURE] Provides a `node.mysql_root_connection()` method that returns a hash
  with everything you need to connect as root. Note that the keys are symbols,
  not strings.

## 0.1.0 (2016-09-06)

* First tagged release
